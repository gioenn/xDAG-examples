# xDAG-examples

Currently [xSpark](https://github.com/gioenn/xSpark) (Extended Spark) can adapt applications with constant DAG.
This repository contains some examples of more complex application with conditional statements that makes their DAGs change over different executions.
This examples will be useful to evaluate strategies to make xSpark support these scenarios.
